## 🛠️ Technical notes (for developers)

- **Pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript** - no build tools, no frameworks, no dependencies to install
- Two files: `index.html` (worksheet generator) and `quiz.html` (interactive quiz) - easy to host anywhere, not just GitHub Pages
- Uses [Claude AI](https://anthropic.com) (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514` model) via the Anthropic API
- API calls are made directly from the browser using the `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` header
- The API key is kept only in browser `sessionStorage` for the current tab session and is cleared when the tab is closed - never transmitted to any third-party server
- Google Fonts (Nunito) loaded from CDN - works offline if cached
- Dark mode supported automatically via `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Print stylesheet built in - no extra tools needed for clean PDF export

### How to update the app after deployment

1. Make your changes to `index.html` and/or `quiz.html` on your computer
2. Go to your GitHub repository
3. Click on the file you want to update (`index.html` or `quiz.html`) in the file list
